# Balancing_Rotating_Machinery-Vibration_Engineering_Fundamentals

Background
Rotating or reciprociating machinery such as engines, compressors, motors, and turbomachinery (such as the type found in rocket engines), will inherently, due to the nature of the machine operation, have a presence of vibration. This vibration may lead to excessive wear of bearings, crack initiation, loosening of fasteners, and/or mechanical failure (Rao, 2004).
One of the primary culprits of this vibration is typically the presence of unbalanced mass in at least one of the mechanical components in the rotating machine assembly, or multiple across the entire assembly. To mitigate, or lessen this effect, balancing of components and assemblies is performed during the manufacturing process.
